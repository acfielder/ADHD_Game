# About this Project

This project began in a search for new ADHD treatments to work alongside existing medication-base treatments. My goal is to utilize serious games as means of treating executive function deficits in those with ADHD to improve daily life over time. The game consists of mini-games based on cognitive tasks that focus on a particular executive function and together will make up a full length game with a theme of crime investigation training.
